This is a simple test post written by me. Now, it's not *that* exciting (hey does 
styling work here?) since I just wanted to get this up and running. It seems to 
work though, so that's good... I guess. Hopefully I'll have more HTML and web-dev 
know-how in the future (not that I enjoy it as much as more local programming, 
such as software, it's just good to know).
